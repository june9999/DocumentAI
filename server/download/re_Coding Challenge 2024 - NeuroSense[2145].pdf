Document Processing Pipeline
Objective:
Build a document processing pipeline that allows users to upload files (PDFs, etc.)
from the frontend, store the uploaded files in Google Cloud Storage, and once the
files are uploaded use Document AI to extract text from these files, and display
the extracted text on a separate page in the frontend.
Note: Users should be able to upload multiple files at once & text should be
extracted from all these files in one batch.
Key Components:
Frontend (React.js):
Implement a React Flow diagram with nodes representing different
stages of the pipeline. (https://reactflow.dev)
Create a node for file upload, allowing users to upload documents.
● Design the frontend with an intuitive and user-friendly interface
using React components.
Backend (Django):
Develop Django API endpoints to handle file uploads and communication
with Google Cloud.
Store uploaded files in Google Cloud Storage.
● Utilise Document AI to extract text from the uploaded documents.
Google Cloud Integration:
Configure Google Cloud Storage for file storage.
Integrate Document AI for text extraction.
